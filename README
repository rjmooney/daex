Current version: .02a

Minimal documentation until I get more time. :)

- Extract the contents of the archive (I assume you've managed this somehow).
- Type "make"
- As "root", type "make install"

Unless you have world read permissions set on your CD-ROM device, I suggest
running DAEX as root.  Yes, I realize DAEX could be installed SUID, but it's
almost 4am, and like, I need sleep. :)  Operation is simple:

usage: daex [-d device] [-o outfile] [-s drive_speed] [-t track_no]

   -d device      :  ATAPI CD-ROM device. (default: /dev/wcd0c)
   -o outfile     :  The name of the recorded track. (default: output.wav)
   -s drive_speed :  The speed at which the CD audio will be read.
                     (default: max) (ex. 4 = 4x (706kb/sec)
   -t track_no    :  The track number to extract. (default: 1)

The drive speed option isn't implemented.  Currently, it defaults to 4x.

The audio file is stored as a 2 channel, 16-bit, 44100hz WAVE.  This should
be somewhat configurable in the near future.  Bear with me.

This is an ALPHA version of the software.  This is not by far the final 
release.  If you have ideas that you'd like to see in future updates of the 
software, let me know.  I'm definately interested in hearing from you.

I think that's all.  Let me know if you find any bugs.  They suck.
