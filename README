------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digital Audio EXtractor (DAEX)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Digital Audio EXtractor, or DAEX, extracts digital audio from an
IDE-ATAPI CD-ROM which can then be saved as a PCM WAV file. As long as your
drive supports CDDA (CD Digital Audio), you should have no problems getting
DAEX to run.

DAEX is freeware. You may distribute it freely in it's original form.

Send me your comments! I can be reached at rmooney@iss.net.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
System requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAEX currently supports the following platforms:

  FreeBSD 2.2.6 -> 3.0

Patches (see Patch Downloads) are available for the following platforms:

 FreeBSD 2.2.6-RELEASE and 2.2.7-RELEASE
 FreeBSD 3.0-CURRENT (as of 3.0-19980804-SNAP -- also works under 
                      FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch downloads
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current patch revision: 1.0

DAEX kernel patches may be obtained at:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the ATAPI modifications to your FreeBSD kernel, follow below. The
example used a FreeBSD 2.2.6 system:

   earthtone:~# whoami
   root
   earthtone:~# patch -p < atapimods_1.0_freebsd2.2.6-release.patch

At this point, the following files are modified:

   /usr/src/sys/i386/isa/atapi.h
   /usr/src/sys/sys/cdio.h
   /usr/include/sys/cdio.h
   /usr/src/sys/i386/isa/wcd.c

Once you have installed the above patch file, you will need to recompile the
kernel. It is _strongly_ recommended you back-up your current running
version of the kernel. An example follows.

First, back-up your current version of the kernel:

   earthtone:~# cd /
   earthtone:/# cp kernel kernel.nodaex

Next, recompile, and install the resulting kernel:

   earthtone:/# cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf
   earthtone:/usr/src/sys/i386/conf# config GENERIC
   Kernel build directory is ../../compile/GENERIC
   earthtone:/usr/src/sys/i386/conf# cd ../../compile/GENERIC
   earthtone:/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC# make depend
   earthtone:/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC# make
   earthtone:/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC# make install

Finally, reboot the system:

   earthtone:/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC# reboot

If you encounter any errors, please feel free to drop me a note. Please
include any relevant information that will help me debug the problem.

DAEX Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to compile the source immediately after you've
uncompressed the archive. However, it is possible that the Makefile included
in the distribution will require minor modifications.

To extract, and compile DAEX, enter the following (the bold face indicates
what you should enter):

  earthtone:~$ tar xfz daex.tgz
  earthtone:~$ cd daex
  earthtone:~/daex$ make

To install DAEX, enter the following as root:

  earthtone:~/daex# make install

DAEX is installed set-UID root, so that it may access your CD-ROM device. If
this isn't acceptable, you may remove the SUID bit, or change the
owner/group permissions to fit your requirements. DAEX (obviously) must
still be able to access the CD-ROM.

You should now be able to begin extraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAEX Caveats
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAEX does not currently support jitter correction (though, it should by the
first major release).

This alpha version does not support multiple matches from the CDDB server.
I hope to have this feature in before beta.  Silly, but I haven't had a
whole lot of time to spend on it. :(
