DAEX -- Disclaimer
=============================================================================

Neither I, nor the contributors take responsibilty for mishaps that may
result from use of DAEX.  I'll make every effort to help people out with any 
trouble related to DAEX they may have, but I can't guarantee the absolute 
satisfaction of every user.

Also, I realize there are issues concerning the piracy of audio tracks.  I
would strongly recommend using DAEX for something other than piracy.

DAEX -- Application files
=============================================================================

You should be able to compile the binaries immediately after you've 
uncompressed the archive - it's quite possible, however, that the Makefile 
included in the distribution will require some minor modification.

To extract, and compile DAEX, enter the following:

	tar xfz daex_0.3a.tgz
	cd daex_0.3a
	make

To install DAEX, enter the following as root: 

	make install

DAEX is installed set-UID root, so that it may access your CD-ROM device.
If this isn't acceptable to you, you can simply remove the SUID bit, or
change the group/owner permissions to fit your requirements.  DAEX (obviously)
must still be able to access the CD-ROM.

You should now be able to begin extraction.


=============================================================================
DAEX -- Usage
=============================================================================

usage: daex [-d device] [-o outfile] [-s drive_speed] [-t track_no]

   -d device      :  ATAPI CD-ROM device. (default: /dev/wcd0c)
   -o outfile     :  The name of the recorded track. (default: output.wav)
   -s drive_speed :  The speed at which the CD audio will be read.
                     (default: MAX)

                       -s 1 == 1x (176 kbytes/sec)
                       -s 2 == 2x (353 kbytes/sec)
                       -s 3 == 3x (528 kbytes/sec)
                       -s 4 == 4x (706 kbytes/sec)

   -t track_no    :  The track number to extract. (default: 1)


The device option attempts to have DAEX read from the specified device
instead of the default.

The outfile option sets the name of the file which will be used to store
the extracted digital audio.

The drive speed option will change the rate at which data is read from the 
disc.  This is useful when you seem to be getting alot of retry messages.
Decreasing the drive speed will sometimes help.

The track number specifies the track you'd like to extract.


=============================================================================
DAEX -- Examples
=============================================================================

Example 1:  
==========

To copy track 4 to "04_bottom.wav" at 4x, you would enter:

	daex -t 4 -o 04_bottom.wav -s 4


Example 2:
==========

To copy track 2 to "02_lucky.wav" at the maximum speed your drive will
support, you would enter:

	daex -t 2 -o 02_lucky.wav


Example 3:
==========

To copy track 11 to "11_speechless.wav" at 1x, using the second IDE CD-ROM
device, you would enter:

	daex -t 11 -o 11_speechless.wav -d /dev/wcd1c -s 1


=============================================================================
DAEX -- Notes
=============================================================================

The audio file is stored as a 2 channel, 16 bit, 44.1Khz WAVE.  This should
be somewhat configurable in the near future.  Bear with me.

This is not by far the final release.  If you have ideas that you'd like 
to see in future updates of the software, let me know.  I'm definately 
interested in hearing from you.

I think that's all.  Let me know if you find any bugs.  They suck.
