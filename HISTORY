      -  Cleaned up the code a bit, fixed a memory leak.

      -  Added setuid() support.

      -  DAEX now resets to maximum attainable speed after extraction, 
         assuming the drive speed was set in the first place.

         is the current track number.
      -  Modified constant names, added constants for drive speed descriptions.
      -  Fixed string length checking to prevent core dumps.
